# Blocks That Turn 'Round - IDD Final Project

# Team:

Jesse Wayne 

Benjamin Yellin

Sandra Ebirim


# Idea: 

We mounted two servos on a box cardboard box and glued a small box with a face onto each servo. Another less wide cardboard box sits above the box with servos and is attached to a string wound around a stepper motor that is screweed onto a third cardboard box that contains the two smaller boxes.
