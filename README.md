# Collapsing Blocks - IDD Final Project

# Team:

Jesse Wayne 

Benjamin Yellin

Sandra Ebirim


# Idea: 

Our idea is to create a set of blocks, that exists in a certain formation. When the blocks detect a face, using a camera and computer vision, the blocks will then change formation or collapse. After a certain amount of time following the self destruction, the blocks will reconstruct themselves back to the original formation.
